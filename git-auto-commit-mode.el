;;; Commentary:

;; git-auto-commit-mode is an Emacs minor mode that tries to commit
;; changes to a file after every save.

;; When `gac-automatically-push-p' is non-nil, it also tries to push
;; to the current upstream.

;; When `gac-automatically-pull-p' is non-nil, it also tries to pull
;; from the current upstream.

;; When `gac-debounce-interval' is non-nil and set to a number
;; representing seconds, it will only perform Git actions at that
;; interval. That way, repeatedly saving a file will not hammer the
;; Git repository.
